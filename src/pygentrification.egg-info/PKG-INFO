# PyGentrification: Gentrification Indices

A python package for calculating and visualizing gentrification indices from published academic research

## Description

The term “gentrification” encapsulates complex and interconnected social, economic, political, and physical processes that lead to a specific type of neighborhood change. Dr. Devin Bunten, an Assistant Professor of Urban Economics and Housing at MIT, defined gentrification as “…the territorial expansion of a wealthy community into a disinvested neighborhood, the installation of the social and legal regimes of the newcomers, and the deployment of new physical capital, both on a small scale – by homeowners undertaking renovations – and on a larger scale, by landed capitalists and public sector officials keen to raise revenue. It is the disruption and displacement of the original residents and their spatially realized social networks.” [^1] 
 

Government – at local, state, and federal lees – creates conditions that facilitate gentrification processes through targeted policy, investment, and subsidies. These conditions enable private actors, such as developers, lenders, builders, and real estate companies, to generate and accumulate wealth in neighborhoods that previously experienced chronic disinvestment[^2]. Together, these actors can “revitalize” a neighborhood, but with profit as their primary motivator, they have little incentive to consider the social and cultural fabric of a neighborhood or the communities that will be able to experience the benefits of their investment. 

Gentrification also requires newcomers. In early stages of gentrification, newcomers, who are often white with lower incomes and high levels of educational attainment, may be drawn to historically disinvested neighborhoods because of their need for affordable housing. These newcomers can serve as a signal of gentrification potential for developers and may advocate for new investment and amenities in their neighborhood. This neighborhood change, in turn, can draw wealthier newcomers who can afford increased housing costs[^2]. 

Gentrification is one cause of displacement. Residents in gentrifying neighborhoods can be forced to move due to increasing costs of rentals, property taxes, and local amenities, which can lead to evictions, foreclosures, and pressure for low-income homeowners to sell well below the market value of their homes to predatory buyers. Even if long-time residents do not physically move, they can experience displacement from their social networks, local culture, and sense of community[^2].   

Researchers have developed many methods to quantify, measure, and predict the complex processgentrification. These methods generally use on multiple indicators at several time periods. Researchers combine these indicators, as well as changes in those indicators over time, into an index that aim to quantify if the area has gentrified, if the area is vulnerable to gentrification, or some of other measure related to their particular theory of gentrification. Indicators often include measures related to race, educational attainment, housing costs, and housing tenure.

We developed this package to allow researchers to explore and compare different gentrification indices for their area of interest. The first version of this package has functions to calculate the indices from Bates (2013)[^3] and Ding et al. (2016)[^4], which both can be calculated from American Community Survey and Census data. 

### Bates (2013)

Bates (2013) calculated three indices using data from three years, each 10 years apart, (years 0-2) that together give a picture of gentrification in an area of interest: vulnerability to gentrification, presence of gentrification-related demographic change, and home value typology. The gentrification-related demographic change index is based on the gentrification index presented in Freeman (2005)[^5].   

#### Bates (2013) - Vulnerability to Gentrification

### Ding et al. (2016)

Ding et al. (2016) usese data from 2 years (years 1-2) to calculate one index that classifies tracts as experiencing intense gentrification, moderate gentrification, weak gentrification, no gentrification, or as non-gentrifiable.

#### Ding et a. (2016) - Gentrification Index

Both indices are calculated using data at the census tract level for a single county. This package include functions to directly the pull data from the American Community Survey and Census and their respective Tiger/Line geometries and combine data accross years with conflicting geometries using areal interpolation from the Tobler package.

### Executing program

##API Calls

This module contains all the data requests a user might need to make to calculate the indices included in the package. This includes using 5 Year - American Community Survery, Dicennial Census, and TIGER Census data.

Each index requires data at the tract level and data for the county as a whole. Identiy the county and state using FIPS codes. 
The two example calls below would return the two dataframes needed to calculate the bates-freeman indices and ding index for Philadelphia County (101) in PA (42) using data from 2000, 2010, and 2020.

The function will return data in EPSG 4269, but requires a proj_parameter that indicates the projected crs that will be used for areal interpolation needed to harmonize data to census tract boundaries for different years.

```
from pygentrification.api_calls import get_api_data_tract, get_api_data_county

tract_gdf = get_api_data_tract("42", "101", years = [2000, 2010, 2020], indices = ["bates", "ding"], proj_crs = "EPSG: 2272")

county_gdf = get_api_data_county("42", "101", years = [2000, 2010, 2020], indices = ["bates", "ding"])

```


##Bates and Freeman Indices

This module contains the data prep steps, index calculation, and dataframe creation of the Bates-Freeman index


calc_batesfreeman is a function that calculates the index according to Bates-Freeman, as cited above. If using a GeoDataFrame retrieved with the functions above, an example call would be: 

```
from pygentrification.bates_freeman_indices import calc_bates_freeman

bates_freeman_gdf = calc_batesfreeman(county_gdf, tract_gdf, inplace = False)

```

Users may also use data retrieved in other ways as long as:
*one is a gdf at the tract level of the study area and one is a df or gdf values for the area as a whole 
*each dataset has data for the acs and census variables required for calculating the indices in this script for the years specified. 
*they specify column column names as a list with an order that corresponds exactly with the default values for th cols_tract and cols_area parameters.

```
cols_area = ['area_med_house_inc_yr1', 'area_med_house_inc_e_yr1', 'area_med_house_inc_yr2', 'area_med_house_inc_e_yr2', 'area_med_fam_inc_yr2', 'area_med_fam_inc_e_yr2']
cols_tract = ['pop_tenure_yr1', 'owner_yr1', 'renter_yr1', 'pop_tenure_yr2', 'owner_yr2', 'renter_yr2', 'pop_25_over_yr1', 'ba_degree_m_yr1', 'ma_degree_m_yr1', 'prof_degree_m_yr1', 'doc_degree_m_yr1', 'ba_degree_f_yr1', 'ma_degree_f_yr1', 'prof_degree_f_yr1', 'doc_degree_f_yr1', 'pop_25_over_yr2', 'ba_degree_m_yr2','ma_degree_m_yr2', 'prof_degree_m_yr2', 'doc_degree_m_yr2', 'ba_degree_f_yr2','ma_degree_f_yr2', 'prof_degree_f_yr2', 'doc_degree_f_yr2','pop_race_yr1', 'white_yr1', 'pop_race_yr2', 'white_yr2', 'med_fam_inc_yr2', 'med_home_val_yr0', 'med_home_val_yr1', 'med_home_val_yr2', 'med_house_inc_yr1', 'med_house_inc_yr2', 'tot_house_yr2', 'new_house_col1', 'new_house_col2', 'new_house_col3']
```
    

##Ding Index

This module contains the data prep steps, index calculation, and dataframe creation of the Ding index


calc_batesfreeman is a function that calculates the index according to Ding, as cited above. If using a GeoDataFrame retrieved with the functions above, an example call would be: 

```
from pygentrification.ding_index import calc_ding

ding_gdf = calc_ding(county_gdf, tract_gdf, inplace = False):

``` 

##Folium Maps

This module contains functions to create Folium maps from the output of Bates-Freeman and Ding functions hosted on a local HTML site.

The crs for the input gdf MUST be EPSG: 4269.

This function takes in the GeoDataFrame generated by the calc_batesfreeman function fand outputs and map object of a Folium map. It saves an html file of the map object to the working directory.

```
from pygentrification.folium_funcs import bates_freeman_result_map

bates_freeman_result_map(bates_freeman_gdf, filename = 'bates_freeman_map.html'):
```

This function takes in the GeoDataFrame generated by the calc_ding function fand outputs and map object of a Folium map. It saves an html file of the map object to the working directory.

```
from pygentrification.folium_funcs import ding_result_map 

ding_result_map(ding_gdf, filename = 'ding_map.html'):
```

Users may also use data retrieved in other ways as long as:
*one is a gdf at the tract level of the study area and one is a df or gdf values for the area as a whole 
*each dataset has data for the acs and census variables required for calculating the indices in this script for the years specified. 
*they specify column column names as a list with an order that corresponds exactly with the default values for th cols_tract and cols_area parameters.

```
cols_area = ['area_med_rent_yr1', 'area_med_rent_yr2', 'area_med_home_val_yr1', 'area_med_home_val_yr2', 'area_med_house_inc_yr1', 'area_med_house_inc_yr2']
cols_tract=['med_rent_yr1', 'med_rent_yr2', 'med_home_val_yr1', 'med_home_val_yr2', 'pop_25_over_yr1' 'ba_degree_m_yr1', 'ma_degree_m_yr1', 'prof_degree_m_yr1', 'doc_degree_m_yr1, ba_degree_f_yr1', 'ma_degree_f_yr1', 'prof_degree_f_yr1', 'doc_degree_f_yr1', 'pop_25_over_yr2', 'ba_degree_m_yr2', 'ma_degree_m_yr2', 'prof_degree_m_yr2', 'doc_degree_m_yr2', 'ba_degree_f_yr2', 'ma_degree_f_yr2', 'prof_degree_f_yr2', 'doc_degree_f_yr2', 'med_house_inc_yr1', 'med_house_inc_yr2']
```
