# Gentrification Indices

A python module for calculating and visualizing gentrification indices from published academic research

## Description

The term “gentrification” encapsulates complex and interconnected social, economic, political, and physical processes that lead to a specific type of neighborhood change. Dr. Devin Bunten, an Assistant Professor of Urban Economics and Housing at MIT, defined gentrification as “…the territorial expansion of a wealthy community into a disinvested neighborhood, the installation of the social and legal regimes of the newcomers, and the deployment of new physical capital, both on a small scale – by homeowners undertaking renovations – and on a larger scale, by landed capitalists and public sector officials keen to raise revenue. It is the disruption and displacement of the original residents and their spatially realized social networks.” [^1] 
 

Government – at local, state, and federal lees – creates conditions that facilitate gentrification processes through targeted policy, investment, and subsidies. These conditions enable private actors, such as developers, lenders, builders, and real estate companies, to generate and accumulate wealth in neighborhoods that previously experienced chronic disinvestment[^2]. Together, these actors can “revitalize” a neighborhood, but with profit as their primary motivator, they have little incentive to consider the social and cultural fabric of a neighborhood or the communities that will be able to experience the benefits of their investment. 

Gentrification also requires newcomers. In early stages of gentrification, newcomers, who are often white with lower incomes and high levels of educational attainment, may be drawn to historically disinvested neighborhoods because of their need for affordable housing. These newcomers can serve as a signal of gentrification potential for developers and may advocate for new investment and amenities in their neighborhood. This neighborhood change, in turn, can draw wealthier newcomers who can afford increased housing costs[^2]. 

Gentrification is one cause of displacement. Residents in gentrifying neighborhoods can be forced to move due to increasing costs of rentals, property taxes, and local amenities, which can lead to evictions, foreclosures, and pressure for low-income homeowners to sell well below the market value of their homes to predatory buyers. Even if long-time residents do not physically move, they can experience displacement from their social networks, local culture, and sense of community[^2].   

Researchers have developed many methods to quantify, measure, and predict the complex processgentrification. These methods generally use on multiple indicators at several time periods. Researchers combine these indicators, as well as changes in those indicators over time, into an index that aim to quantify if the area has gentrified, if the area is vulnerable to gentrification, or some of other measure related to their particular theory of gentrification. Indicators often include measures related to race, educational attainment, housing costs, and housing tenure.

We developed this package to allow researchers to explore and compare different gentrification indices for their area of interest. The first version of this package has functions to calculate the indices from Bates (2013)[^3] and Ding et al. (2016)[^4], which both can be calculated from American Community Survey and Census data. 

### Bates (2013)

Bates (2013) calculated three indices using data from three years, each 10 years apart, (years 0-2) that together give a picture of gentrification in an area of interest: vulnerability to gentrification, presence of gentrification-related demographic change, and home value typology. The gentrification-related demographic change index is based on the gentrification index presented in Freeman (2005)[^5].   

#### Bates (2013) - Vulnerability to Gentrification
| Indicator      | Output values |  variable  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -----------  |

### Ding et al. (2016)

Ding et al. (2016) usese data from 2 years (years 1-2) to calculate one index that classifies tracts as experiencing intense gentrification, moderate gentrification, weak gentrification, no gentrification, or as non-gentrifiable.

#### Ding et a. (2016) - Gentrification Index
| Indicator      | Output values |  Variable  |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | -----------  |
| Median Household Income at census tract and county levels | 0 (gentrifiable = False): Median Household Income in tract > Median Household Income in county, 1 (gentrifiable = True): Median Household Income in tract < Median Household Income in county | hhi_crit, gentrifiable  |
| % Change in Median Rent at census tract and county levels | 0: % Change in Median Rent in tract < % Change in Median Rent in county, 0.5: % Change Median Rent in tract > % Change Median Rent in county | rent_crit  |
| % Change in Median Home Value at census tract and county levels | 0: % Change in Median Home Value in tract < % Change in Median Home Value in county, 0.5: % Change Median Home Value in tract > % Change Median Home Value in county | value_crit  |
| % Change in people over 25 without a college degree at census tract and county levels | 0: % Change in people over 25 without a college degree in tract < % Change in people over 25 without a college degree in county, 1: % Change in people over 25 without a college degree in tract > % Change in people over 25 without a college degree in county  | edu_crit  |
| Sum of Gentrification Criteria  |  0 - 3 (Sum of above 4 variables)  | crit  |
| Presence of Gentrification  |  False: crit < 2.5, True: crit>= 2.5  |  gentrifying  |
| **Gentrification Status**  | 'Weak Gentrification': meets gentrification criteria and in bottom two quartiles of criteria for change in median home values and rent, 'Moderate Gentrification': meets gentrification criteria and in middle two quartiles of criteria for change in median home values and rent, 'Strong Gentrification': meets gentrification criteria and in top quartile of criteria for change in median home values and rent, 'No Gentrification': tract is gentrifiable but does not meet gentrification criteria, 'Nongentrifiable': Does not meet income criteria in year 1 to be gentrifiable  |  gent_status  |

Both indices are calculated using data at the census tract level for a single county. This package include functions to directly the pull data from the American Community Survey and Census and their respective Tiger/Line geometries and combine data accross years with conflicting geometries using areal interpolation from the Tobler package.

### Executing program

##API Calls.py

This module contains all the data requests a user might need to make to calculate the Indices. This includes using 5 Year - American Community Survery, Dicennial Census, and TIGER Census data.

```
This is an example of an internal api call which is used as a part of the comprehensive api call

census_request_tract(2017, 42, 101, ding_vars)

```


```
This is an example of how to use the comprehensive api call for both the tract and county level

get_api_data_tract(42, 101, years = [2010, 2020], indices = "ding", crs = 'EPSG:4269')
get_api_data_county(42, 101, years = [2010, 2020], indices = "ding", "bates")

```

##Bates and Freeman Indices

This module contains the data prep steps, index calculation, and dataframe creation of the Bates-Freeman index

```
calc_batesfreeman is a function that calculates the index according to Bates-Freeman, as cited above

calc_batesfreeman(df_area, df_tract, cols_area = [list], cols_tract = [list] inplace = False):

```


```
This function calculates the margin of error for the summed value of a column (in this case, the aggregated value across all census tracts)

moe_alltracts(df, col)

```

##Ding Index

This module contains the data prep steps, index calculation, and dataframe creation of the Ding index

```
calc_batesfreeman is a function that calculates the index according to Ding, as cited above
calc_ding(df_area, df_tract, cols_area = [list], cols_tract = [list] inplace = False):

``` 

##Folium Maps

This module contains functions to create Folium maps from the output of Bates-Freeman and Ding functions hosted on a local HTML site.


```
This function takes in the GeoDataFrame generated by the calc_batesfreeman function fand outputs and map object of a Folium map. It saves an html file of the map object to the working directorand opens it in a web browser.
def bates_freeman_result_map(result_df, filename = 'bates_freeman_map.html'):
```
